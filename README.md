# Haming-Code
This project demonstrates the implementation of the Hamming Code algorithm, which is used for detecting and correcting single-bit errors in transmitted data. It includes encoding, error simulation, and decoding processes, illustrating how redundancy bits can be used to improve data integrity in digital communication systems.
